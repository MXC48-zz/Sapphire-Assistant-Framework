# Sapphire-Assistant-Framework
A free and open source offline assistant for Android phones. Should work for Android versions 7.1.1 to 10.0. I'm aiming to have it work with 11, just not a priority yet

I've just uploaded a prealpha APK (under releases on github) that can be tried out, but it's likely to be *VERY BUGGY*. If it does work, it will illustrate the proof of concept. That aside, there's not too much to see since most is happening on the backend. More to come soon

I am starting to update the wiki based on my own hacking ideas for it, roadmaps, ideas, and the like. If you have a question about how it should work, feel free to open an issue and ask. I'll add the information to the wiki so that way the whole community benefits

If you'd like to donate to help support this project (the sooner I can buy out my work contract, the sooner I can do this full time) you can donate to https://paypal.me/pools/c/8vWDFtysV4
